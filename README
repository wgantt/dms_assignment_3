Files and Usage
---------------

  - data_generator.py: Python script used to generate an arbitrary number of
      records given a JSON schema.
  - experiments: Directory containing all the Bash scripts used to run our
      experiments, as well as the output of those scripts.
  - json, json.cpp: Files from the jsoncpp library, used for reading the json
      schema file.
  - library.cc/.h: Class and function declarations and definitions for the
      entire program.
  - Makefile: Self-explanatory.
  - msort.cc: Code for running msort.
  - bsort.cc: Code for running bsort.
  - report.pdf: The PDF containing our report for this assignment.
  - schema_example.json: Provided sample schema that we used for all of our
      experiments.

  1. To run msort, first run `make msort` and then execute it as follows:

  ./msort <schema_file> <input_file> <output_file> <mem_capacity> <k> <sort_attribute>

  NOTE: Our msort implementation supports only a single sorting attribute.


  2. To run bsort, first run `make bsort` and then execute it as follows:

  ./bsort <schema_file> <input_file> <out_index> <sort_attributes>

  NOTE: a) Our implementation supports multiple sorting attributes. You may pass
           one or more space-separated parameters for sort_attributes.
           Parameters that are passed earlier have higher priorities in sorting
           than those that are passed later.
        b) If you're using a MacOS (or if you're getting an error message from Makefile),
           you should try changing the 22nd line in leveldb/include/leveldb/comparator.h
           from `virtual ~Comparator();` to `virtual ~Comparator(){};`.
        c) Once you run the program, it creates a file system directory named
           `leveldb_dir` for a leveldb database inside the parent directory of your
           current location. Every time you run bsort, make sure to delete the directory
           Beforehand. Otherwise, it raises an error for having the database already exist.

Implementation Details
----------------------

The C++ files are reasonably well-commented and much can be learned about our
implementation simply by reading through them. However, it will be valuable
to provide a broad overview here and to discuss certain points that may not 
be evident from scanning the source code.

- Msort

For pass 0, the in-memory sort (mk_runs), we used a vector to store the record
from the current run and used the built-in C++ vector `sort` method. While
implementing this, we forgot that the instructions requested that this be done
with a heap-allocated buffer and unfortunately never found the time to go back
and fix this. The runs are all written to a temporary file "helper.txt."

For subsequent passes, in which progressively longer runs are merged together,
we allocate the requested k input buffers and the one output buffer, each of
size buf_size, before doing any of the merging. The buf_size parameter is
calculated as mem_capacity / (k+1). The input buffers are represented as
RunIterators, as per the instructions. When performing the merging, we use 
a priority queue to store the next records in each of the k input buffers to
be merged. This obviates the need for a linear scan over all k buffers each
time a record is to be merged (i.e. written to the output buffer). When the
output buffer is full, it is flushed to the output file and cleared.

In general, we maintain two helper files, "helper.txt" (mentioned above) and
"helper2.txt". For a given pass, except the last, one of these serves as the
input and the other serves as the output. Only on the final pass do we
actually write to the user-specified output file. We're sure there's a way of
doing this that uses *just* the output file, but figuring out how proved more
of a headache than we cared to suffer.

Undoubtedly, though, our greatest struggle in this assignment was abiding by
the memory usage limits. Although msort uses input and output buffers of the
size dictated by k and by the mem_capacity, and although we used minimal heap
memory elsewhere, we did not meet the requirement that total program memory
usage not exceed mem_capacity. We abided by the spirit of it, if not the
letter.

- Bsort

We create a leveldb database and open a connection to "../leveldb_dir" using
our custom comparator. Our custom comparator subclassing the Comparator class
takes the record schema as an argument. Because our schema contains an array
of sort-by attributes, whose array index provides sorting priority (with zero
index having the highest priority) and elements are the corresponding sorting
attributes, we didn't have to pass an additional parameter to the custom
comparator for sorting attributes.

Each record we read in gets stored in the database, with the string record
converted into a slice being both the key and the value. The record stored
under its own record slice is then divided into multiple parts by the comparator
in order to get the sorting attribute value. Starting from the attribute with 
the highest sorting priority, we extract its value by using the attribute's
position among all attributes (i.e. offset) and length; from the slice, we remove
everything positioned before the attribute's "offset plus the number of ','s"
in the record. Then from the remaining slice, we create a new slice that refers
to the attribute value that we're interested in by using the referenced data and
its length.

Since we start the comparison of attributes from the highest sorting priority,
as we extract more attribute values, if we have two keys that are not equal,
we immediately return -1, for the first key argument smaller than the second one,
or +1, for the second key argument smaller than the first one. If no return is
dade, then we return 0 at the end to indicate that the two keys are equal.

As a final step, we iterate through all key,value pairs in the database, using
leveldb::Iterator which supports iteration in ascending order of keys. As we
process each entry, we write it to the output file.
